<b>Facial Contours App</b>

"ðŸ“± Thrilled to announce the successful completion of task 2 in the @LetsGrowMore virtual internship, where i successfully built an Android app - Facial Contours! ðŸ—¿

â„¹ This app provides Smile Probability, Left Eye Open Probability, Right Eye Open Probability And Landmarks Like Nose Position And Bottom Mouth Position Of Captured Faces.

ðŸš€ Developed using the firebase ML kit to detect faces allowed me to explore more about the Firebase ML kit.

Looking forward for more learning and gaining experiences.
